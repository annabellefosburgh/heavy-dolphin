# ThirstTrap Web Application

## Description

When you're at a restaurant or bar, the number of drink options can be overwhelming. With so many choices, it's easy to feel unsure of what to order. The ThirstTrap web application aims to make the decision-making process easier for users by allowing them to enter criteria that matches their mood and preferences, such as alcohol/non-alcoholic, category, spirit, and more.

Beyond simplifying the drink selection process, ThirstTrap also serves as an application for discovering new drink options and expanding your knowledge of beverages. By presenting users with recommended drinks that meet their selected criteria, ThirstTrap can introduce them to drinks they may not have otherwise tried.

With ThirstTrap, users can confidently make informed drink choices that align with their tastes and preferences, all while discovering new and exciting drinks to enjoy.
